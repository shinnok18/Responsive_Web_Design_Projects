            It was good I felt comfortable purchasing because this was my first time buying from this website for the actual polo so it was good.but how ever the only thing that was making me a little cautious was when I purchased my hoodie it did not tell me how many days it would take to get delivered. Like i know you guys have a app to track it I would be more comfortable if it gave me some what of a an estimate of how long it would take to be delivered to my house so that I don’t have to keeping using the app unless I really really needed to see where exactly where it’s at but over all it was good.

            Good products and sales apportunities are great. Would for the website to be better though and to be able to cancel an order without having to wait until it ships and arrives. Overall I believe the website needs upgrading and more trendy items should be developed to attract a younger audience with better designs and patterns that still represent the brand well. Food for though!

I'm guessing Covid has something to do with that but PLEASE get my size back in stock!

            Anytime that I make a purchase from U.S. Polo website, I would be happy! I get my orders in soonest time, get them in a good package and of course get high quality products. I haven't needed to return any item till this time.
            Also, they mostly have very good items on sale and mostly provide us discount code! All these make me a happy customer! Thanks U.S. Polo!

            I’ve been a loyal POLO customer . Love the Quality , colors and styles , Quick delivery and I’m very satisfied except the Hacci SLIM jogger pants I bought for my wife size xs , it fits more like a large or extra large on her even thought the model picture looks SLIM I feel it’s not true to size , hopefully you guys are able to fix that error and respond to this ..

            It was good I felt comfortable purchasing because this was my first time buying from this website for the actual polo so it was good.but how ever the only thing that was making me a little cautious was when I purchased my hoodie it did not tell me how many days it would take to get delivered. Like i know you guys have a app to track it I would be more comfortable if it gave me some what of a an estimate of how long it would take to be delivered to my house so that I don’t have to keeping using the app unless I really really needed to see where exactly where it’s at but over all it was good.

            Good products and sales apportunities are great. Would for the website to be better though and to be able to cancel an order without having to wait until it ships and arrives. Overall I believe the website needs upgrading and more trendy items should be developed to attract a younger audience with better designs and patterns that still represent the brand well. Food for though!

            I have rec'd the package of clothing and it was received in normal fashion. I have not had much time to try everything on but I expect that the sizes ordered were correct as I am always a size extra small, or small.

            Order 2 pair of khaki pants. Love the fit and material of the pants. Unfortunately one pair of pants Is defective. It has light blue streaks going through it. I am not able to wear this pair. This is why I left 4 stars instead of 5. Hopefully customer service will be able to help me.

            I really liked the shirts I ordered but to be honest I was really disappointed that after a year you still do not have my size in pants. I really liked your jeans that I bought 2 years ago but you have not had my size ever since, I check all the time. I'm guessing Covid has something to do with that but PLEASE get my size back in stock!
